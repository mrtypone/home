                <p>Saint Valentine was a Catholic priest who had also worked as a doctor. He lived in Italy during the third century AD and served as a priest in Rome.

                    Historians don‚Äôt know much about Valentine‚Äôs early life. They pick up Valentine‚Äôs story after he began working as a priest. Valentine became famous for marrying couples who were in love but couldn‚Äôt get legally married in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius II, who outlawed weddings. Claudius wanted to recruit lots of men to be soldiers in his army and thought that marriage would be an obstacle to recruiting new soldiers. He also wanted to prevent his existing soldiers from getting married because he thought that marriage would distract them from their work.
